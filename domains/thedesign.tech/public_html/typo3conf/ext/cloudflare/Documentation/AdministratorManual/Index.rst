This chapter describes how to manage the extension from a superuser point of
view.

Before installing the extension, make sure you have a Cloudflare account and
your website's domain (e.g., ``example.com``) is configured on Cloudflare. You
may quickly and easily sign up for a free account on
https://www.cloudflare.com/a/account/my-account.
